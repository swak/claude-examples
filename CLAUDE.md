# Claude Code Examples & Demonstrations

## Project Overview

This repository showcases practical examples of using Claude Code for various software engineering tasks including development, testing, security analysis, and code review. Each subdirectory contains a standalone demonstration project highlighting different capabilities of Claude Code.

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents an individual demonstration project:

```
claude-examples/
├── nextjs/           # Next.js application development with Claude Code
├── [future folders]  # Additional demonstration projects
└── Claude.md         # This file - Claude Code context and instructions
```

## Instructions for Claude Code

When working in this repository, Claude Code should:

### For Each Project Folder

1. **Treat each folder as an independent project** - Each demonstration has its own dependencies, configuration, and purpose
2. **Follow project-specific conventions** - Respect the framework and language conventions of each project
3. **Maintain existing patterns** - When modifying code, follow the established patterns in that specific project

### Development Guidelines

- **Testing**: Run appropriate tests for each project using their specific test runners
- **Security**: Perform security reviews when requested, focusing on defensive security practices
- **Code Review**: Provide thorough reviews considering best practices for each framework
- **Documentation**: Update project-specific README files when making significant changes

### Common Tasks by Project Type

#### Next.js Projects (`nextjs/`)
- Use `npm run dev` for development server
- Run `npm run build` before committing major changes
- Follow React/Next.js best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Test with `npm test` if configured

#### Future Project Types
Additional project types will be added with their specific instructions as they are created.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a testing ground and showcase for Claude Code capabilities across different technologies and use cases. Each project demonstrates real-world scenarios where Claude Code can assist with:

- Initial project setup and configuration
- Feature development
- Bug fixes and debugging
- Unit and integration testing
- Security analysis
- Code refactoring
- Performance optimization
- Documentation generation
