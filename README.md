# Claude Code Examples Repository

A collection of demonstration projects showcasing Claude Code's capabilities in software development, testing, security analysis, and code review.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains multiple example projects that demonstrate how Claude Code can be effectively used for various engineering tasks. Each project folder represents a different technology stack or use case.

## 📁 Projects

### Next.js Application (`nextjs/`)
A modern Next.js application demonstrating Claude Code's ability to work with React, TypeScript, and modern web development workflows.

**Technologies:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

### [More projects coming soon...]

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (for JavaScript/TypeScript projects)
- Git
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation & Running Projects

Each project has its own dependencies and setup. Navigate to the specific project folder and follow these general steps:

#### For Next.js Project

```bash
# Navigate to the Next.js project
cd nextjs

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### General Pattern for Node.js Projects

```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd [project-name]

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install

# Run development server (check package.json for specific scripts)
npm run dev

# Run tests if available
npm test

# Build project
npm run build
```

## 📖 Documentation

- Each project contains its own README.md with specific instructions
- See `Claude.md` for Claude Code-specific context and guidelines
- Check individual project folders for technology-specific documentation

## 🧪 Testing

Testing approaches vary by project:

- **Next.js**: Uses Jest and React Testing Library (when configured)
- Additional testing frameworks will be documented as projects are added

## 🔒 Security

These are demonstration projects. While they follow security best practices, they should not be deployed to production without proper security review.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a personal demonstration repository. Feel free to fork and create your own examples!

## 📝 Claude Code Usage

When using Claude Code with this repository:

1. Claude Code will recognize the `Claude.md` file for context
2. Each project folder is treated as an independent project
3. Claude Code will follow project-specific conventions and patterns
4. Use Claude Code for:
   - Feature development
   - Bug fixes
   - Testing
   - Code reviews
   - Security analysis
   - Documentation updates

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. Choose a project folder to work in
2. Install dependencies for that specific project
3. Use Claude Code to assist with development tasks
4. Test changes locally
5. Review code with Claude Code before finalizing

## 📌 Notes

- Each demonstration project is self-contained
- Projects may use different package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm)
- Check individual project README files for specific requirements
- Some projects may require additional setup (databases, API keys, etc.)

## 🚦 Project Status

| Project | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Next.js | ✅ Active | Modern web application with React and TypeScript |
